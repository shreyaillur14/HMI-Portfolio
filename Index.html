        <p class="about">Hi! I'm a fourth-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at KLE Technological
            University,
            Hubballi. I'm passionate about crafting hardware solutions. This portfolio showcases my HMI
            course projects and assignments. I'm eager to contribute to the development of innovative and impactful
            technologies.</p>

        <h2>Why HMI</h2>
        <p class="why-hmi">HMIs bridge the gap between humans and machines, making complex systems easier to operate.
            They provide
            user-friendly
            interfaces with real-time data, allowing operators to monitor and control processes efficiently. This leads
            to increased
            productivity, reduced errors, and enhanced safety through early warning systems and data-driven insights.
            HMIs
            ultimately optimize system performance and operator experience.</p>

        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <p class="assignments">The MATLAB-based Vehicle Dashboard Simulation offers a realistic driving experience. It
            displays key vehicle parameters
            like speed, temperature, and battery voltage in real-time. Users can interact with virtual controls and
            receive alerts
            for critical conditions. This simulation serves as a valuable learning tool for understanding vehicle
            systems and
            dynamics.</p>
